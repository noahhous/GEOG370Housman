<h1>Homework 8: West Virginia Cloropleths-- Different Ratios and Categorizations </h1>
<h2>Noah Housman</h2>
<div><h1> Map 1</h1></div>
<h3>This first map uses a ratio which normalizes the number of people aged 19 to 64 who have a disability, using the entire population of pepole 19 to 64 in the denomintaor. These numbers were then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. The categorization method I used was equal count (quantile). I thought this method was fairly appropriate because it did a great job of showing the contrast between the Southern and Northern counties, while still accounting for those counties which fell somewhere in between both extremes. I really can not think of any cons for using this categorization method in this context, it appeared to work really well.  </h3>

<h3>This next map uses a ratio which normalizes the number of people aged 19 to 64 who have a disability, using the entire West Virginia population of those who have a disability (in the 19 to 64 age group) in the denomintaor. These numbers were then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. I think this way of normalizing the data is good only if you were seeking to determine which counties have the largest share of West Virginia's population of individuals with disabilites. The categorization mode I used was natural breaks (jenks). I think this is a mediocre choice for the nature of this data, because it highlights a few distinct counties which seem to have a high percentage, but it doesn't really tell us a lot about the other counties. However, it does a great job of identifying these hotspot counties if that is in fact your aim.  </h3>

<div><h1> Map 3</h1></div>

<h3>This final map uses a proportion which uses the number of indviduals with disabilites who do not have insurance in the numerator, and the number of individuals with disabilites who do have insurance in the denomintaor-- all within the 19 to 64 age group. The categorization method used was pretty breaks. I think this is an decent method to use here; there appears to be an acceptable degree of color gradient diversity among the counties. One con I can identify is that many of the counties fit into the same middle ground categories, so it feels like the map isn't telling us a whole lot.  </h3>
